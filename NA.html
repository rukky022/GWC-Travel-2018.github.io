<p>Los Angeles Landmarks </p>
<div>DisneyLand </div>
<div>DineyLand is a fun theme park for families to go and have fun. DisneyLand has been open since 1955. The cost for tickets at DisneyLand varies by date.
  The cost for tickets for 2 days $105.00, 3 days $93.34, 4 days $76.25 and 5 days $64.00.The park hours is 8AM-12AM. The more days you stay the less the tickets cost. But DisneyLand gets
  tiring the 2nd day for most adults. Thats why most adults pay for the 2 days, and do something else while they in Califorina, because theres more theme
  parks than DisneyLand. You will learn more about the other parks in my next landmark.Also if your kid is under the age of 3 years old they dont need a ticket.
  But rememeber DisneyLand is not a cheap place to vist, so make sure you have your money together before you go.</div>
 <div>Universal Studios Hollywood </div>
 <div> Universal Studios Hollywood is another theme park is Los Angeles. So if you get tired of DisneyLand bring your kid to Unverisal Studios Hollywood.
   Everybody thinks its like Universal in Flordia but its not. In my opinion the one in California is more fun for all ages than the one in Flordia.
   Its something for everybody to do. For Universal Studios Hollywood you buy a go card you will save 50%. General addminsion $109-$124, Universal
   Express $179-$249, VIP Experience $349, and 2 day general addminsion $139-$159 you can learn more about it on https://store.universalstudioshollywood.com/PurchaseTickets.aspx.
   Make sure you check the calander to see if they have aviable tickets on the day or days you decide to go.
   <div>The Los Angeles Theatre </div>
   <div> The Los Angeles Theatre its not like a regular theatre. If you ever been to the Fox in Atlanta its just like that but better. The theatre has 2,000
     seats, its a historic movie palace. Its located in downtown Los Angeles.
